1. For Decision Tree Code :
    The program using the following python3 libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn
    If needed, then can be installed by using:

    pip3 install numpy
    pip3 install pandas
    pip3 install matplotlib
    pip3 install sklearn


    Running the code:

    To run the code, either the colab notebook can be used or the command line.

    The link to the colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A-bpdq_m3DudBf23LrzTEdsNSDgBH10U?usp=sharing

    The maximum depth input is needed to be given as command line argument

    To run the code in command line, use 'python3 decision_tree.py {max depth}' (without the quotes).
